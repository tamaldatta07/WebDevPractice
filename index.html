    <p> <u>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers.</u> <strong>Many students define paragraphs in terms of length:
            a
            paragraph is
            a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc</strong>. <em>In reality, though,
            the
            unity and
            coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.</em>

    <pre>Respected Sir/Madam,

        I am writing to you on behalf of the students of [Class/Grade] to request the organization of a visit to the planetarium. Such a visit would greatly enhance our understanding of astronomy and provide a practical learning experience.

        Yours sincerely,
        Tamal
